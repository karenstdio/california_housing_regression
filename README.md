# California Housing Regression

This project applies both **Linear Regression** and **Ridge Regression** to the California Housing dataset using Scikit-Learn.

## Project Overview

- Uses a real-world dataset with 8 numeric features describing housing attributes in California.
- Predicts the median house value (scaled to dollars).
- Applies standard scaling to features for model stability.
- Compares Linear vs Ridge Regression using performance metrics:
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - R² (Coefficient of Determination)
- Visualizes:
  - Predicted vs Actual values
  - Residual distribution

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.7
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Usage

Run the notebook or script to train the models and view the evaluation results.
